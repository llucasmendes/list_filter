# ListFilter

## Desafio 02 - Filtragem em listas
> In this challenge, we create a new project with a function that, given a list of strings that represent numbers or not (example ["1", "3", "6", "43", "banana", "6" , "abc"]), filter all numeric elements in the list and return how many odd numbers are in that list.
